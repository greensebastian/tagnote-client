# Tagnote Client

This is a react app for rapid note-organization where each note is only categorized by a number of tags.

It is hosted [here on Google App Engine](https://tagnote.sebastiangreen.se)!

## Usage

The app has two main areas, which are the notes overview and the note editor. Access the notes editor by clicking any of the existing notes, or by making a new one.

You save your notes with Ctrl+S or by clicking the link in the banner. The notes are stored in your browser, and so can be accessed offline.

The notes are not synchronized or stored anywhere on the web, only in your browser.

## Filtering

Notes are filtered exclusively by tags, and notes where any of the tags include any of the words in the filter will show up.
